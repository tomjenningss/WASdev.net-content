Java EE has continued to enjoy a huge amount of success over many years with broad adoption, enabling a spectrum of workloads from the simplest web apps to business critical systems in the most demanding environments. It is implemented by a wide variety of Java technology providers and has underpinned WebSphere ever since there’s been a Java EE (or J2EE). One of its great strengths, along with its robust architecture, has been its community of contributors. IBM is proud to have been one of the platform specification collaborators and implementers since the very beginning and we are delighted that Java EE is moving with the times to <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/theaquarium/opening-up-java-ee">an open foundation for its ongoing development</a> following the completion of Java EE 8 this year.

Earlier this year I <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/docs/microprofile/">wrote</a> about the creation of the <a href="https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.microprofile">Eclipse MicroProfile</a> project to lead innovation around the modernization of enterprise Java for microservices in an open community. I’m particularly pleased, as a member of <a href="http://microprofile.io/">the MicroProfile community</a>, to see this movement from Java EE in the same direction. The MicroProfile mission to deliver new capabilities for enterprise Java can be much more efficient if we’re all living in the same neighbourhood. With the recent announcement of <a href="/wasdev/blog/2017/08/09/microprofile-1-1-announced/">MicroProfile 1.1</a> and the upcoming availability of MicroProfile 1.2, the future of open enterprise Java looks bright.

The <a href="/wasdev/websphere-liberty/">WebSphere Liberty</a> team is feverishly working in these communities to bring the latest capabilities to Liberty so you can use them straight away. For an early peek at new MicroProfile and Java EE 8 features take a look at the <a href="/wasdev/docs/new-in-latest-earlyaccess">latest Liberty Beta.</a>
