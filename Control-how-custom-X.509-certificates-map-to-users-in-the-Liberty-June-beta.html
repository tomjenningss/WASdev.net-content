<h2>Control how custom X.509 certificates map to users in Liberty's LDAP and basic user registries</h2>

You now have complete control over how certificates are mapped to users in the user registry. 

The out-of-the-box X.509 certificate mappers for the LDAP user registry did not handle custom OID's, parsing of certificate fields and included custom filtering of only a subset of the certificate's fields. For example, there was no support for Subject Alternative Name (SAN). The out-of-the-box X.509 certificate mapper for the basic user registry only supported using the subject's <code>cn</code> RDN for the user name. With the X509CertificateMapper API, you can now map a X.509  certificate to a user in the user registry in any way that is required.

<h3>Enabling the custom mapping using the BELLs feature</h3>

Implement the <code>com.ibm.websphere.security.X509CertificateMapper</code> interface and include it in a JAR. Also include in the JAR a Java ServiceLoader provider configuration file (<code>META-INF/com.ibm.websphere.security.X509CertificateMapper</code>) that contains the fully-qualified class names of any X509CertificateMapper implementations to be used in the Liberty server. Each implementation must be preceded by a comment line containing a key-value pair containing the key <code>x509.certificate.mapper.id</code> and a unique ID as the value. Use this ID to reference the implementation from the <code>server.xml</code> configuration file. Load these implementations into Liberty's classpath using the <code>bells-1.0</code> feature and a shared library. 

Example configuration file entry:

[code]
           # x509.certificate.mapper.id=basicMapper
           com.mycompany.BasicMapper
           # x509.certificate.mapper.id=ldapMapper
           com.mycompany.LdapMapper
[/code]

Example <code>server.xml</code> configuration for two separate X509CertificateMapper implementations to a basic and LDAP user registry:

[code lang="xml"]
          <server>
              <featureManager>
                  <feature>basicRegistry-1.0</feature>
                  <feature>ldapRegistry-3.0</feature>
                  <feature>bells-1.0</feature>
              </featureManager>

              <!--
                      The library contains any X509CertificateMapper implementations.
               -->
              <library id="mylibrary">
                  <file name="${shared.resource.dir}/libs/myLibrary.jar" />
              </library>

              <!--
                      Bundle the library using the BELLS feature.
               -->
              <bell libraryRef="mylibrary" />

              <!--
                      Reference the X509CertificateMapper(s) from the user registries by configuring the
                      certificateMapMode attribute to "CUSTOM" and referencing the ID configured in the
                      provider configuration file in the certificateMapperId attribute.
               -->
              <basicRegistry ... certificateMapMode="CUSTOM" certificateMapperId="basicMapper" />
              <ldapRegistry ... certificateMapMode="CUSTOM" certificateMapperId="ldapMapper" />
          </server>
[/code]

<h3>Enabling the custom mapping with a user feature</h3>

Implement the <code>com.ibm.websphere.security.X509CertificateMapper</code> interface and include it in the user feature bundle. Define the X509CertificateMapper implementations as Service Components. The Service Component must specify the <code>x509.certificate.mapper.id</code> property which defines a unique ID as the value. The property can either be specified manually in the Service Component XML file or using the property field of the Component annotation. Load these implementations into Liberty's classpath with the user feature. Use this ID to reference the implementation from the <code>server.xml</code> configuration file.

Example <code>server.xml</code> configuration for configuring two separate X509CertificateMapper implementations to a basic and LDAP user registry:

[code lang="xml"]
          <server>
              <featureManager>
                  <feature>basicRegistry-1.0</feature>
                  <feature>ldapRegistry-3.0</feature>
                  <feature>usr:myFeature-1.0</feature>
              </featureManager>

              <!--
                      Reference the X509CertificateMapper(s) from the user registries by configuring the
                      certificateMapMode attribute to "CUSTOM" and referencing the ID configured in the
                      Service Component in the certificateMapperId attribute.
               -->
              <basicRegistry ... certificateMapMode="CUSTOM" certificateMapperId="basicMapper" />
              <ldapRegistry ... certificateMapMode="CUSTOM" certificateMapperId="ldapMapper" />
          </server>
[/code]

<h2>Submit usage metrics from a Liberty server to IBM Cloud Private</h2>
The new <code>usageMetering-1.0</code> feature adds the capability to register a Liberty server with an IBM Cloud Private metering service and submit usage metrics.

IBM Cloud Private metering enhances the way IBM middleware products can be registered and tracked. It helps track product instances and report usage metrics. Using IBM Cloud Private metering, organizations will have the opportunity to extend and achieve the benefits of cloud environments. For example, IT administrators will be able to register all of their products in a single dashboard, simplifying the management tasks. And capacity planners will be able to right-size their environments based on usage data.
