David leads the team that builds the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/websphere-liberty/">Docker support for WebSphere Liberty</a>. In his free time, he goes orienteering, which he got into he was an 8-year-old Cub Scout. From orienteering, he started running and, as well as cycling his short commute to work each day, he regularly runs at lunchtimes with other IBMers from the Hursley lab.

<blockquote>I enjoy running - perhaps because it gives me a chance to get away from a computer and think.</blockquote>

David has <em>a lot</em> of WebSphere and Java EE experience, having worked on WebSphere Application Server from V3.5 to V6 before moving to other teams for a few years in which he was an end-user of WebSphere Application Server. He came back to the WebSphere Liberty development team about 3 years ago to work on the Cloud Foundry buildpacks. One day, he asked the question about who was working on the Docker support that one of our executives had recently announced--you can probably guess how that one ended up!

<blockquote>I'm most proud of <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/websphere-liberty/">our official image on Docker Hub</a> because of the ease and simplicity of just being able to type: <code>docker run websphere-liberty</code>.</blockquote>

His first experience of Java was Java 1.0, which was horribly slow but which he used for a couple of projects during his MEng in Engineering and Computer Science at Oxford University. His original interest was in electronic engineering but that wasn't an option at the university so he threw in the Computer Science to mix things up a bit, and then came to love that side more.

<blockquote>I was probably about 8 when I first started coding in Basic on a BBC Micro B.</blockquote>

For his third year project at university, he co-authored <a href="http://david.currie.name/othello">a Windows version of the Othello board game</a>. He later built a Java version of the Othello board game, which <a href="http://david.currie.name/java-othello">you can play on his website</a>. More recently, he collaborated with some other Liberty developers to write a sample Liberty feature for using some of the <a href="https://github.com/WASdev/sample.netflixoss.wlp">Netflix OSS libraries like Archaius, Hystrix, and Eureka with Liberty</a>. These days, though, he's all about <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> and finds many opportunities in the container space to learn new technologies.

<blockquote>Perhaps it's corny but I really love the work that I'm doing right now. Docker has the potential to make such a big difference to the way our customers work both in development and operations.</blockquote>

But his favourite technologies in his everyday life are his bicycle, which never ceases to amaze him that it keeps going despite the lack of care and attention he gives it, and his electric toothbrush.

<h2>More from David</h2>

You can find David on Twitter as <a href="https://twitter.com/dcurrie">@dcurrie</a> and on GitHub as <a href="https://github.com/davidcurrie">davidcurrie</a>. He also blogs regularly about tech, running, orienteering, and other stuff on his personal website, <a href="http://david.currie.name/">david.currie.name</a>.

David has written <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/blog/author/david_currie/">several blog posts</a> here on WASdev.net.

You'll probably bump into him at DockerCon conferences, having been to the last few. He was also at OSCON London in 2016.

<blockquote>At DockerCon, the opportunity to interact directly with the Docker developers is immense.</blockquote>

<h2>Something random about David</h2>

David is a qualified orienteering Club Coach and has coached on several <a href="http://www.britishorienterring.org.uk/">British Orienteering Federation</a> tours in Scotland and Norway.
