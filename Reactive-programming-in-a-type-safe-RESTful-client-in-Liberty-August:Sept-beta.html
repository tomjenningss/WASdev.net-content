Program reactively in a type-safe RESTful client, define security tokens in a container-neutral way to simplify deployment, and enable all the MicroProfile features in a convenient way in the August/September 2018 beta of <a href="/wasdev/websphere-liberty/">WebSphere Liberty</a>.

Thanks to your support for our regular beta programme, we are able to release new Liberty features every few months. We recently released <a href="/wasdev/blog/2018/06/29/java-ee-8-liberty-18-0-0-2/">WebSphere Liberty 18.0.0.2</a>, built on <a href="https://openliberty.io/blog/2018/06/29/full_java_ee_8_liberty_18002.html">Open Liberty 18.0.0.2</a>.

Look out for more betas over the coming months. If you just can't wait, take a look at the <a href="https://openliberty.io/downloads/">daily builds of Open Liberty</a>.

<h2>Program reactively in a type-safe RESTful client (MicroProfile Rest Client 1.1)</h2>

MicroProfile Rest Client 1.1 expands on the 1.0 version by providing asynchronous method support using Java 8's CompletionStage APIs. It also allows better integration with other MicroProfile technologies and third parties and adds support for URIs.

The new async method support makes reactive programming possible in a type-safe RESTful client. Prior to this feature, you would either have to sacrifice type-safety and use the JAX-RS 2.X Client APIs to get asynchronous/reactive support, or sacrifice async/reactive support for type-safety. No more!

The other improvements are minor in nature but still make life easier for developers. You no longer need to specify the <code>@Dependent</code> annotation on REST client interfaces when used with CDI. You can also use URIs, which can be constructed without throwing a MalformedURLException, saving a few lines of unnecessary try/catch blocks.

REST client interface methods that return a CompletionStage are treated as asynchronous:

[code lang="java"]
...
MyClient client = RestClientBuilder.newBuilder()
                                   .executorService(executor)
                                   .build(MyClient.class);
CompletionStage<Widget> cs = client.getWidget(widgetId);
cs.thenApply(...);
...
@Path("/widget")
public interface MyClient {
    @GET
    @Path("/{widgetId}"
    CompletionStage<Widget> getWidget(@PathParam("widgetId") String widgetId);
}
[/code]

To enable the MicroProfile Rest Client 1.1 feature, add it to the <code>server.xml</code>:

[code lang="xml"]
<featureManager>
  <feature>mpRestClient-1.1</feature>
</featureManager>
[/code]

<h2>Verify security tokens in a container-neutral way to simplify deployment (MicroProfile JWT 1.1)</h2>

Previously, a server using MicroProfile JWT had to be specifically configured to define token issuers and store or obtain the public keys used to validate the JWT tokens. Now this information can be included in an app, or supplied directly in, or referenced by, system properties or environment variables.

MicroProfile JWT 1.0 allows authentication and identity propagation using JWT tokens. However the mechanism for configuring the token issuers, public keys or JWKS URLs used for token validation is container-specific. MicroProfile JWT 1.1 uses MicroProfile Config 1.x to allow token issuers, public keys, and JWKS URLs to be defined at the server or in an application in a container-neutral way. This simplifies deployment and improves interoperability. MicroProfile JWT 1.1 also adds Authentication Filter support, so MicroProfile JWT authentication can be limited to a subset of application URLs. 

Learn about MicroProfile JWT in <a href="https://www.openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-jwt.html">Securing microservices with JSON Web Tokens</a>.

To enable the MicroProfile JWT 1.1 feature:

<ol>

<li> Add the <code>mpJwt-1.1</code> and <code>appSecurity-2.0</code> features to the <code>server.xml</code> and, optionally, define an <code>mpJwt</code> configuration if configuration beyond public keys and issuers is needed:

[code lang="xml"]
<featureManager>
  <feature>mpJwt-1.1</feature>
<feature>appSecurity-2.0</feature>
</featureManager>

<mpJwt id="myMpJwt" ... />
[/code]

</li>
<li> Supply either the token issuer and public key or the public key retrieval path or URL that will be used to retrieve the key. These can be system properties, environment variables, or entries in a <code>microprofile-config.properties</code> file within an application. For example, add to the <code>microprofile-config.properties</code> file one of the following entries:

<ul>
<li>
[code]
    mp.jwt.verify.publickey.location=/META-INF/orange.pem
[/code]</li>

<li>
[code]
    mp.jwt.verify.publickey=(pkcs#8 key goes here)

    mp.jwt.verify.issuer=https://server.example.com
[/code]

For UNIX and Linux platforms (which do not accept dots in environment variables), use <code>_</code>.
</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ol>

<div id="mpconvenience" >
<h2>Conveniently enable all MicroProfile 2.0 or MicroProfile 1.4 features</h2>

Enable all the MicroProfile 2.0 features or all the MicroProfile 1.4 features at once with the new convenience features. MicroProfile 2.0 is based on Java EE 8 technologies while MicroProfile 1.4 is based on Java EE 7 technologies.

To enable MicroProfile 2.0 features:

[code lang="xml"]
<featureManager>
  <feature>microProfile-2.0</feature>
</featureManager>
[/code]

This is the equivalent of individually enabling the following features: jaxrs-2.1, cdi-2.0, jsonp-1.1, jsonb-1.0, mpConfig-1.3, mpFaultTolerance-1.1, mpHealth-1.0, mpJwt-1.1, mpMetrics-1.1, mpOpenAPI-1.0, mpOpenTracing-1.1, mpRestClient-1.1.

To enable MicroProfile 1.4 features:

[code lang="xml"]
<featureManager>
  <feature>microProfile-1.4</feature>
</featureManager>
[/code]

This is the equivalent of individually enabling the following features: jaxrs-2.0, cdi-1.2, jsonp-1.0, mpConfig-1.3, mpFaultTolerance-1.1, mpHealth-1.0, mpJwt-1.1, mpMetrics-1.1, mpOpenAPI-1.0, mpOpenTracing-1.1, mpRestClient-1.1.
