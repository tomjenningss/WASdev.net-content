WebSphere Liberty V17.0.0.2 is here! It includes many new enhancements. If you are interested in what’s new join our <a href="https://www.imwuc.org/p/ca/vi/sid=664">WebSphere Liberty V17.0.0.2 Virtual Proof of Technology on June 28th, 2017</a>. For a sneak peek read on.

For those of us on the Liberty development team, the last three months has taken us from the start of spring and into the warmer and lighter summer months. Despite the distractions of the blossom on trees, the need to cut the grass, and tend the flower beds we have been busy preparing the 17.0.0.2 release of Liberty.

If I were to reverse engineer a single theme that covers everything we have done in 17.0.0.2, it would be ease of use. We have done a lot to make Liberty simpler to use; some examples include the ability to go directly from the developer install on WASdev directly to Liberty Core, a better maven/WDT experience, or making it radically simpler to configure authentication using social media login from Twitter or Facebook.

Looking forward at what is currently available in the beta there are improvements to how outbound SSL works to enable selection based on target host and port, a REST API to help validate DataSource connection configuration is valid, as well as improvements to the support for the upcoming Eclipse MicroProfile API’s for writing micro services.

WebSphere Liberty 17.0.0.2 will be delivered simultaneously through WASdev as well as directly through IBM Cloud. This release is the second Liberty release that has a version of 17. We are incrementing the version based to 17 based on the year to 2017.

As usual, we will be doing a webcast to explain all the great new stuff in the release. The webcast will also include the latest updates on licensing and product support. You’ll have a chance to get your hands on a download containing the driver and a set of labs to help get started quickly.
